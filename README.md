# The Scratchpost Connector
This repo contains my first ever CAD project - a replacement for a piece that connects two pieces of a cat scratchpost. 
The original part consisted of an injection molded material which has weakened over time and deteriorated to a point where I could just crumble it in my hands. 
Needless to say, it was not able to stand up to the strain put on it by two adorable rambunctious felines anymore. 

And while replacements for the sisal-wrapped cardboard tubes that make up most scratch posts today are readily available, I just wanted to use this opportunity to design a part to replace the component that actually failed - because it is rarely the cardboard tube itself that fails but the thing that connects the two. 
And I wanted an excuse to practice my budding CAD skills, so there's that. 

# Some notes
The original part was designed for a cardboard tube with an outer diameter (OD) of 64mm and an inner diameter (ID) or 59mm. It can be scaled to any size of tube, though. The cut at the bottom fits an M10 nut, but can also be modified for any other size of nut. 
In cat scratch posts, two sizes seem to be common, which is M8 and M10.
