# The Scratchpost Connector
This repo contains my first ever CAD project - a replacement for a piece that connects two pieces of a cat scratchpost. 
The original part consisted of an injection molded material which has weakened over time and deteriorated to a point where I could just crumble it in my hands. 
Needless to say, it was not able to stand up to the strain put on it by two adorable rambunctious felines anymore. 

And while replacements for the sisal-wrapped cardboard tubes that make up most scratch posts today are readily available, I just wanted to use this opportunity to design a part to replace the component that actually failed - because it is rarely the cardboard tube itself that fails but the thing that connects the two. 
And I wanted an excuse to practice my budding CAD skills, so there's that. 

# Some notes
The original part was designed for a cardboard tube with an outer diameter (OD) of 64mm and an inner diameter (ID) or 59mm. It can be scaled to any size of tube, though. The cut at the bottom fits an M10 nut, but can also be modified for any other size of nut. 
In cat scratch posts, two sizes seem to be common, which is M8 and M10.

# Where is this going?
Well..it is what it is. You might be able to put this to good use building a custom "modular" scratch tree for your cat where you can just go out and buy a bunch of cardboard tube, sisal and set to work - or you might just need a replacement for something that broke. This part can probably do either. If you have other ideas where to take this: be my guest.

# Do you have this file in $Format?
At this point I have built the part in Autodesk Fusion360, which as of January 2021 is free for private, non-commercial use.
Do I plan to create it in other formats? Maybe. But not right now.

# On the printer I used
I do not know how great the influence of the printer used for this project on your result would be, but I feel I should add this information as a sort of a caveat. 
To print this part, I used a derivative of the infamous Anet A8, also referred to as the AM8/BLV. The only parts left from what started out as the A8 at this point are the stepper motors and the power supply. The rest of the printer has been replaced over time. The frame is now made up for Aluminium profiles as opposed to the wobbly and creaky acrylic frame. All axes have been upgraded to Hiwin-Style linear rails and the board is an SKR 1.4, which is a 32bit board. The extruder has been modified to a Bowden style and the hotend is now a E3D v6 style one, with a titanium heatbreak. So there was just not a lot of reference for me to draw on when dialing in the printer. Just bear this in mind when trying to reproduce this part. Your results may vary.
